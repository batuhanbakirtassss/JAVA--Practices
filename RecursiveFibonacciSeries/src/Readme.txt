# Recursive Fibonacci Series Generator

This program generates a Fibonacci series using a recursive approach. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

## How It Works

The program calculates the Fibonacci series using a recursive function. The user specifies the number of terms to generate, and the program prints the Fibonacci series up to the specified number of terms.
