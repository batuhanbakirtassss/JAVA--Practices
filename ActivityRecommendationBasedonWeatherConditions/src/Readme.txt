This program, "ActivityRecommendationBasedonWeatherConditions," is a Java application that recommends activities based on the temperature input by the user. If the temperature is less than 5, the program recommends skiing; if the temperature is between 5 and 15, it recommends going to the cinema; if the temperature is between 16 and 25, it recommends having a picnic, and if the temperature is greater than 25, it recommends going swimming. The user enters the temperature using the console, and the program displays the corresponding activity recommendation.
