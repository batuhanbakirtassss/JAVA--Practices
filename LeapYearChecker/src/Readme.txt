Leap Year Checker
This Java program checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. Leap years have 366 days instead of the usual 365 days. The program accurately determines whether a year is a leap year based on specific rules.

How It Works
When the program is launched, it prompts the user to enter a year.
The entered year is checked to determine if it is a leap year.
The result is displayed on the screen, indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.
Leap Year Calculation Rules
The leap year calculation follows these rules:

If a year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
However, if a year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.
Unless, if a year is divisible by 400, it is still a leap year.
For example, the year 2020 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4, but the year 1900 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
