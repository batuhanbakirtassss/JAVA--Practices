# Pattern-Based Method Creation

This Java program demonstrates a recursive method that follows a specific pattern based on the given rule.

## Rule

The program takes a user-input integer value 'n' and applies the following rule:
1. Subtract 5 from 'n' and print its value.
2. Repeat step 1 until 'n' becomes 0 or negative.
3. After reaching 0 or negative, add 5 to 'n' and print its value.
