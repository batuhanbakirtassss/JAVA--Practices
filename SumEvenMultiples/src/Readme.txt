Sum of Even Numbers and Multiples of 4 Program
This Java program uses loops to continuously accept user inputs until a single number is entered. It then calculates the sum of the even numbers and multiples of 4 from the entered values and displays the result.

When the program is executed, the user is prompted to enter numbers. The program accepts the inputs and checks if each entered value is a single number. If a single number is entered, the program breaks out of the loop and proceeds to calculate the sum.

During the input phase, the program also checks if each entered number is both even and a multiple of 4. If a number satisfies these conditions, it is added to the sum.

After the loop ends, the program displays the sum of the even numbers and multiples of 4 using the System.out.println statement.

The program uses the Scanner class to read user inputs and properly releases resources to ensure clean termination.

This program showcases the use of loops, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations.
