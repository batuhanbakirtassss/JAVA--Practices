# Harmonic Mean Calculator

This is a Java program that calculates the harmonic mean of an array of numbers.

## Description

The program takes an array of numbers, calculates the harmonic sum by summing the reciprocals of the elements, and then uses the harmonic sum to calculate the harmonic mean. The harmonic mean is a type of average that is calculated using the formula `n / (1/x1 + 1/x2 + ... + 1/xn)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `x1`, `x2`, ..., `xn` are the array elements.

## How to Use

1. Open the `HarmonicMeanCalculator.java` file in a Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

2. Modify the `numbers` array with the desired set of numbers for which you want to calculate the harmonic mean.

3. Run the program.

4. The program will display the calculated harmonic mean on the console.

## Example

Suppose you have the array `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`. The program will calculate the harmonic mean for these numbers and display the result.

Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code as you see fit.
