This program is a Java application called "ValidGradeCalculationProgram" that calculates the average of entered grades for five courses, namely mathematics, physics, Turkish, chemistry, and music. The user is prompted to enter grades for each course, and the program checks if each entered grade is within the valid range of 0 to 100. If an entered grade is invalid, it is not included in the calculation of the average. If all entered grades are invalid, the program informs the user and exits. If at least one entered grade is valid, the program calculates the average of the valid grades and informs the user whether they have passed or failed based on the calculated average.
