Chinese Zodiac Calculator
This Java program calculates the Chinese Zodiac sign based on the user's birth year. The Chinese Zodiac is a traditional astrological system in which people are categorized into 12 different animal signs. The program takes the user's birth year as input and determines their Chinese Zodiac sign accordingly.

What is the Chinese Zodiac?
The Chinese Zodiac is an astrological system that has been used for over 4,000 years in Chinese culture. It classifies individuals into 12 different animal signs, representing a 12-year cycle. Each animal sign is associated with specific characteristics and qualities.

How Does the Chinese Zodiac Calculation Work?
The Chinese Zodiac sign is determined by dividing the birth year by 12 and examining the remainder. Each remainder corresponds to a specific animal sign. Here is the mapping:

Birth Year % 12 = 0 ➜ Monkey
Birth Year % 12 = 1 ➜ Rooster
Birth Year % 12 = 2 ➜ Dog
Birth Year % 12 = 3 ➜ Pig
Birth Year % 12 = 4 ➜ Rat
Birth Year % 12 = 5 ➜ Ox
Birth Year % 12 = 6 ➜ Tiger
Birth Year % 12 = 7 ➜ Rabbit
Birth Year % 12 = 8 ➜ Dragon
Birth Year % 12 = 9 ➜ Snake
Birth Year % 12 = 10 ➜ Horse
Birth Year % 12 = 11 ➜ Sheep
