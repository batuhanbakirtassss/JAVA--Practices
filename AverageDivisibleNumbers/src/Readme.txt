Average Divisible Numbers Program
This Java program calculates the average of numbers divisible by 3 and 4 from 0 up to a user-provided number.

When the program is executed, the user is prompted to enter a number. Using a loop, the program checks each number from 0 up to the entered number to determine if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. If a number is divisible by both 3 and 4, it is added to the sum and the count is incremented.

After the loop completes, the program calculates the average by dividing the sum of the divisible numbers by the count. If no divisible numbers are found, a message is displayed to inform the user. Otherwise, the calculated average is displayed.

The program uses the Scanner class to read user input and properly releases resources to ensure clean termination.

This program is intended to demonstrate the usage of loops and conditional statements.Average Divisible Numbers Program
